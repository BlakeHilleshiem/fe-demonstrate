/*
Maybe hero section cycles through with a button to click to navigate to link
stuff like To Do list, tables, forms, paginatation, modals, Page Look a likes, 

bottom is a feedback form

Will need to include documentation in the Readme eventually.


Though it would look nice to post to demonstrate all the time, if there are some public projects I'd be interested in making available I think it would be good to spend time building this stuff.
